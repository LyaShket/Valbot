## Requirements

Only works on 1920 x 1080 resolution. If you wish to add a custom resolution, you need to get your own version of the images from the `images` folder, call them EXACTLY the same name and replace the original files.

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. 
Seems to only work on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.9 

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

You also need a functioning brain, please have one of these; it's very important.

### Windows installation

You will have to have a few things installed before running the sniper. This installation guide assumes that you are on a 64bit Windows system.

First, you will need to install Python. It's recommended to use either version `3.9.0` or `3.8.6`. You must use a Python version above `3.7`. 

### Installing Python

Go to the following link and download Python:

`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe`

Once you have opened the installer, make sure that you add Python to path. Your installer should look like this:

Run through the installer as normal, then download the Valbot files.


## Download

[Download here](https://github.com/MrFums/Valbot/releases/latest)

Click on the zip file that says `Valbot-X.X.X` and unzip to where you would like the bot to be stored. Be advised to not put this in an Admin only folder as the bot must write the folder it is in to store runtime data.


## Instructions

1- Install Python 3.9.0.

2- Open `Install_Packages.bat` as admin to install pakcages using pip. Do this after every update to maintain functionality.

3- Open `Valbot.py` and read the bot console.

4- Navigate the menu and read the information.

5- Put your Valorant shortcut in the bots directory.

6- Follow the instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.

7- If you encounter issues please [create one](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/issues/new) or if you have suggestions please create a [pull request](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/compare)

8- (Optional) Setup a Discord webhook to get updates to your discord server for when the bot has completed a game.
