## Changelog

##2021-03-06-12: Valbot-1.9.0

+ Now detects if the game gets a cheater in it and acts properly
+ Now auto buys the vandal


Notes:

I can't actually test if the cheater detection works properly as I don't understand how you fuckers are getting cheaters in deathmatch.
I'm gonna release this build to github as well, I think the "ban reports" were trolls and / or nothing to do with my program (most of them were asking for free aimbot)


##2021-02-06 :: Valbot-1.8.2 

+ Fixed bot getting stuck in play button loop


Notes:

There is a chance Riot have decided to fuck me in ass and spit on my cheeks so I will not be releasing this build on GitHub.
From now on if any updates are to come out they will ONLY be released on the Discord server: discord.gg/QFC46XKzxU


##2021-01-31 :: Valbot-1.8.1 

+ Ability to pause at any time! Hold F3 to pause and F4 to resume
+ No longer need to use the valorant player card. You can use any card!
+ Minor bug fixes


Notes: 

I will be making a discord server. Check the repo for the link. The bot should resume to whereabouts you are when you pause.

##2021-01-29 :: Valbot-1.8.0 

+ Support for recent Valorant update / season
+ Window Title
+ Improved Discord Presence 
+ Fixed not detecting shortcut in root folder
+ Fixed some minor and rare crashes
+ Fixed play button detected


Notes: 

I have tried to make it so the program will work with future updates and won't require an update.

## Features

* Fully AFK XP farmer
* Discord RPC support
* Discord webhook support
* Optimized and has fail safes for events that may happen during runtime of the game
* Restarts Valorant if detects an issue with it / detects that it isn't running
* Automated restarts to prevent script from ending prematurely 
* Undetected / undetectable
* Easy navigation


## Requirements

Only works on 1920 x 1080 resolution. If you wish to add a custom resolution, you need to get your own version of the images from the `images` folder, call them EXACTLY the same name and replace the original files.

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. 
Seems to only work on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.8 

Install Python 3.8.0 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

You also need a functioning brain, please have one of these.


## Download

[Download here](https://github.com/MrFums/Valbot/releases/latest)

Click on the zip file that says `Valbot-X.X.X` and unzip to where you would like the bot to be stored. Be advised to not put this in an Admin only folder as the bot must write the folder it is in to store runtime data.

## Instructions

1- Install Python 3.8.0.

2- Open `Install_Packages.bat` as admin to install pakcages using pip. Do this after every update to maintain functionality.

3- Open `Valbot.py` and read the bot console.

4- Navigate the menu and read the information.

5- Put your Valorant shortcut in the bots directory.

6- Follow the instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.

7- If you encounter issues please [create one](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/issues/new) or if you have suggestions please create a [pull request](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/compare)

8- (Optional) Setup a Discord webhook to get updates to your discord server for when the bot has completed a game.

In addition to this, if your program crashes and / or you have an error message that contains `psutil.AccessDenied`, you must download a different python version. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57535680/101982606-208ac800-3c6d-11eb-8a6a-964ae43c880b.png) [download here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe)
